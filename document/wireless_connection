The file document some methods to achieve wireless connection between PI and PC.  
Before starting, I have to say that a screen for the raspberry Pi can make my life much more easier...  
Tow methods:  

1. Make PI itself an access point  
There are many methods on the Internet, but I haven't found any that works for me without any problems.  
There is risk to lost even the ethernet connection when configurating the internet setting of PI...so you have no way to find it back without a screen.  

2. Use a router as an AP and connect both PI and PC  

3. static IP for raspberry PI
vim /etc/dhcpcd.conf  
add at the end of the file:

interface eth0  
static ip_address=192.168.1.20/24  
static routers=192.168.1.1  
static domain_name_servers=114.114.114.114  

Then reboot by "sudo reboot"
